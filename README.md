Car Price Prediction using Python Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! This repository contains a Python-based model designed to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. The core of this project revolves around Mini-Batch Gradient Descent and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for model optimization and evaluation.

Project Overview Predicting car prices is a challenging task that involves understanding various factors such as mileage, age, make, and model of the vehicle. This project tackles this problem by employing a regression approach to estimate car prices from a dataset of car listings.

Key Features Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: This optimization technique is used to enhance the efficiency and convergence speed of the model. By processing small batches of data at a time, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent strikes a balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE is utilized as the evaluation metric to measure the model’s performance. It provides a straightforward indication of prediction accuracy by averaging the absolute differences between predicted and actual prices. Implementation Details The repository includes:

Data Preprocessing: Scripts to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it’s ready for model training. Model Training: Implementation of Mini-Batch Gradient Descent to train the regression model. Evaluation: Code to compute MAE and assess the model’s accuracy. How to Use Clone the Repository: Use git clone to download the project to your local machine. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required Python packages by installing them via requirements.txt. Run the Code: Execute the provided scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
